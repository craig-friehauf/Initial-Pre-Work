					In Vienna, Austria on October the twelfth in the year two thousand nineteen Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon is less then two hours. A feat never before performed. With Nikes proprietary technology on his feet and a fleet of pace runners, he finished the race in one hour fifty nine minutes and forty second. To put it in perspective one hundred years ago the fastest known single mile was run in four minutes and twelve second by Norman Taber. Eliud ran 26.2 miles at an average pace of four minutes thirty five seconds per mile. A feat that can't make you wonder about the limits of the human body. Born on November fifth in the year nineteen eighty four, Eliud has a storied career. Including a silver metal in the five thousand meter and has also ran the fastest ever half marathon at fifty nine minutes and twenty five second. Even though his time won't go down as an official record do to minor deviations from the IAAF's official rules. Eliud accomplishment should not be over looked. He remains as one of the few athletes to ever run a IAAF sanctioned  marathon in under two hours and five minutes.
